Ride-hailing services have experienced significant growth in adoption since
2009. Although business models to support the sharing of vehicles have
been present in the United States for more than 15 years, their adoption has
been somewhat limited to niche markets in dense, urban cities or college
campuses. To date, carsharing has attracted over 2 million members in
North America and close to 5 million globally. Conversely, this new model of
“shared mobility” is estimated to have grown to more than 250 million users
within its first five years.
This sector has been projected to generate about 335 billion Dollars by 2025
with an annual growth of 16.5% in revenue.
The rapid adoption of ride-hailing poses significant challenges for the
traditional transportation industry, researchers, policymakers, and planners,
as this disruptive revolution is vastly beyond the control of all key players.
Notwithstanding these strides, the ride hailing industry has its own internal
challenges and short falls that must be solved for the long term survival of
this new industry.
These challenges challenges include payments settlement between drivers
and service providers, leading to drivers owing huge debts, high charges
from fares, difficulties in acquiring private cars (In developing countries)
which creates room for exploits by some few rich individuals and business
men or fleet firms and lack of proper reward systems for referrals.
G-Ride will redefine the ride hailing industry worldwide and will become the
gamechanger in the transport or ride sharing sector. Building the first holistic
platform that solves the aforementioned challenges in this sector,
Genuine Ride has a completely new approach to ride sharing, payment
settlement on the platform and funding - based on blockchain technology.

also use this coin as a mode of payment.
G-Ride is not just a visionary concept. Our uniquely designed ride hailing
app is already developed and available. There are over 13,000 community
members across over 50 countries worldwide who are available to promote,
support and build this concept into a force to recon with in the industry.
We already have reps in almost all countries across Africa, Asia and Europe
where we aim to flourish and expand to every corner of the world.
GMG is the creator and operator of the G-Ride project. GMG evolved from
an online helping community known as Genuine Mutual Help founded by
Jerry J. Drah and Augustus Danyo in 2015 in Accra, Ghana. This community
boasts of over 13,000 members across the globe.The founders worked for
more than three years on the vision and the concept.
The rollout and development of G-Ride platform will be financed via Initial
Coin Offering (ICO). This opens new opportunities and makes GMG an
African pioneer. And it is easy and open to nearly everyone to become part
of the GMG success story. To participate in this project and benefit from this
groundbreaking idea now, you just have to register on the ICO website. You
need a valid email address and an Ether wallet. You don’t have to be a
